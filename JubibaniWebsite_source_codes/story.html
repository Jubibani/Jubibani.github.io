                        <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>I was very <i>interested</i> and <i>passionate</i> in airplanes. but i realized that 
                            the financial fee is very tremendously big! my parents told me they will support me in my goals and dreams.
                            I really felt happy and sad at the same time because i knew the truth that we had no money. <mark class = "Gold">fortunately</mark>, my father 
                            introduced me <a href="https://www.pma.edu.ph/about.php" target="_blank">Philippine Military Academy (PMA)<a>. 
                            since then, i fell inlove with military and was drived to join the airforce.

                        <br>
                        <p>I had to stop 1 year of my college school to focus on my entrance exam. I reviewed whenever i had the chance to review. many of us we're already at the exam site, 4 am.
                            I prayed to God He'll help me. Nevertheless, I failed my first entrance exam. factually, many examinees failed because it was amidst the pandemic. and out of 30,000 examinees.
                             only 200-400 was admitted. The pressure started to flood in.

                        <h3>The Endgame</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>At this time, i was already a first year and an upcoming second year. but i had to divide my units in half to work as a part time to provide for myself and
                            also to give time to review for my entrance exam. so basically i was doing 3 things at the same time! -- but it's that moment that i have learned a lesson from life.
