                        <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>I was very <i>interested</i> and <i>passionate</i> in airplanes. but i realized that 
                            the financial fee is very tremendously big! my parents told me they will support me in my goals and dreams.
                            I really felt happy and sad at the same time because i knew the truth that we had no money. <mark class = "Gold">Fortunately</mark>, my father 
                            introduced me <a href="https://www.pma.edu.ph/about.php" target="_blank">Philippine Military Academy (PMA)<a>. 
                            since then, i fell inlove with military and was drived to join the airforce.

                        <br>
                        <p>I had to stop 1 year of my college school to focus on my entrance exam. I reviewed whenever i had the chance to review. many of us we're already at the exam site, 4 am.
                            I prayed to God He'll help me. Nevertheless, I failed my first entrance exam. factually, many examinees failed because it was amidst the pandemic. and out of 30,000 examinees.
                             only 200-400 was admitted. The pressure started to flood in.

                        <h3>The Endgame</h3>
                        <br>
                        <p>At this time, i was already a first year and an upcoming second year taking I.T course with a <mark class ="Gold">Web development</mark>  major. but i had to divide my units in half to work as 
                            a full-time time to provide for myself and also to give time to review for my entrance exam. so basically i was doing 3 things at the same time! -- but it's that moment 
                            that i have learned a lesson from life.
                        </p>

                        <p>I was very <mark class ="Purple">sleep deprived</mark>. In the morning my brain was always at a vacation meanwhile my body was always at 10%. -- but when it is night, my mind and body acts as if they're like
                            rick and morty at my optimum performance.

                            But i <mark class= "Red">broke down</mark>. I was not able to do all those 3 tasks in 100 %. slowly by slowly, i prioritized my job over my Schooling.
                            I then prioritized my reviewing responsibility over my job and when my entrance exam day came. My supervisor did not let me had a day off and on top of that he gave me overtime 
                            because costumers was too many and they needed their "asset" on the station. -- that was before the day of my exam which resulted me only 1hr of sleep and barely reviewed for the exam day. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I had three priorities. But in times of hardships i started to sacrifice each of them to prioritize which of which within of those "priorities". I am determined to give a third try until no more chances. 
                         But I realized that time is <mark class="Red">running out</mark>. I'm already close to graduation and in my college days and my parents are growing old. i have to give up and pivot my focus on this career.
